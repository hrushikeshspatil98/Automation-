Write a COBOL program and compile to get a load module. Execute through JCL to get the result.
Requirement for program is as follows:-
Create a sequential file for FB, 50 byes and add some example records and input file format can be-
Field	
Type	
Length	GROUP item

StudentId	
9	
7	No
StudentName			Yes
Surname	X	20	No

Initials	
X	
10	No
DateOfBirth			Yes
Year	9	4	No
Month	9	2	No

Day	
9	
2	No
CourseCode	X	4	No
Gender	X	1	No


	Write a COBOL program to reads the above sequential file and display the StudentId, StudentName and the CourseCode of each record in the file. Count the number of Male and Female students and display at the end for count of each Male and Female students
	Write a COBOL program to accept student records from the user and write them to another file.  The program should keep accepting records from the user until spaces are entered instead of a record (i.e.the Enter key is pressed without having entered any data).
